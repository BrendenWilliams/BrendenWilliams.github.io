								<span><a href="http://www.academia.edu/2185038/B-spline_mutual_information_independent_component_analysis"> B-Spline Mutual Information Independent Component Analysis. </a></span><br> Mutual Information is one of the most natural criteria when developing independent component analysis (ICA). Although utilized to some level it has always beendifficult to calculate. We present a new algorithm whichutilizes a contrast function related to MutualInformation based on B-Spline functions. We comparedthis algorithm with benchmarked ICA algorithms suchas FastICA, Infomax and JADE and found it to be veryfavourable with them in performance. <br> Authors:

								<span><a href="https://eprints.usq.edu.au/19990/2/Walters-Williams_Li_AJAS_2011_PV.pdf"> Using Invariant Translation to Denoise EEG Signals </a></span><br>Because of the distance between the skull and the brain and their different resistivitys, Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings on a machine is usually mixed with the activities generated within the area called noise. EEG signals have been used to diagnose major brain diseases such as Epilepsy, narcolepsy and dementia. The presence of these noises however can result in misdiagnosis, as such it is necessary to remove them before further analysis and processing can be done. Denoising is often done with Independent Component Analysis algorithms but of late Wavelet Transform has been utilized. Approach: In this study we utilized one of the newer Wavelet Transform methods, Translation-Invariant, to deny EEG signals. Different EEG signals were used to verify the method using the MATLAB software. Results were then compared with those of renowned ICA algorithms Fast ICA and Radical and evaluated using the performance measures Mean Square Error (MSE), Percentage Root Mean Square Difference (PRD) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).<br>

Its estimation however using B-Spline has not been used before in creating an approach for Independent Component Analysis. In this paper we present a B-Spline estimator for mutual information to find the independent components in mixed signals. Tested using electroencephalography (EEG) signals the resulting BMICA (B-Spline Mutual Information Independent Component Analysis)
exhibits better performance than the standard Independent Component Analysis algorithms of FastICA, JADE, SOBI and EFICA in similar simulations. BMICA was found to be also more reliable than the 'renown' FastICA.<br>

Research has shown that these metrics can improve the performance of these algorithms. Over the years an often popular function is the Euclidean function. In this paper, we investigate a number of different metrics proposed by different communities, including Mahalanobis, Euclidean, Kullback-Leibler and Hamming distance. Overall, the best-performing method is the Mahalanobis distance metric.<br>

								<span><a href="https://eprints.usq.edu.au/6645/"> Estimation of Mutual Information: A Survey.</a></span><br> A common problem found in statistics, signal processing, data analysis and image processing research is the estimation of mutual information, which tends to be difficult. The aim of this survey is threefold: an introduction for those new to the field, an overview for those working in the field and a reference for those searching for literature on different estimation methods. In this paper comparison studies on mutual information estimation is considered. The paper starts with a description of entropy and mutual information and it closes with a discussion on the performance of different estimation methods and some future challenges.<br>
